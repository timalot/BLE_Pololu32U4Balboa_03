// This code was developed for a Balboa unit using 50:1 motors
// and 45:21 plastic gears, for an overall gear ratio of 111.
// Adjust the ratio below to scale various constants in the
// balancing algorithm to match your robot.
const int16_t GEAR_RATIO = 111;

// This constant limits the maximum motor speed.  If your gear
// ratio is lower than what we used, or if you are testing
// changes to the code, you might want to reduce it to prevent
// your robot from zooming away when things go wrong.
//
// If you want to use speeds faster than 300, you should add
// the line "motors.allowTurbo(true);" to setup().
const int16_t MOTOR_SPEED_LIMIT = 300;

// This constant relates the angle to its rate of change for a
// robot that is falling from a nearly-vertical position or
// rising up to that position.  The relationship is nearly
// linear.  For example, if you have the 80mm wheels it should be
// about 140, which means that the angle in millidegrees is ~140
// times its rate of change in degrees per second; when the robot
// has fallen by 90 degrees it will be moving at about
// 90,000/140 = 642 deg/s.  See the end of Balancer.ino for one
// way to calibrate this value.
const int16_t ANGLE_RATE_RATIO = 140;

// The following three constants define a PID-like algorithm for
// balancing.  Each one determines how much the motors will
// respond to the corresponding variable being off from zero.
// See the code in Balance.cpp for exactly how they are used.  To
// get it balancing from scratch, start with them all at zero and
// adjust them as follows:

// ANGLE_RESPONSE determines the response to a combination of
// angle and angle_rate; the combination measures how far the
// robot is from a stable trajectory.  To test this, use your
// hand to flick the robot up from a resting position.  With a
// value that is too low, it won't stop itself in time; a high
// value will cause it to slam back into the ground or oscillate
// wildly back and forth.  When ANGLE_RESPONSE is adjusted
// properly, the robot will move just enough to stop itself.
// However, after stopping itself, it will be moving and keep
// moving in the same direction, usually driving faster and
// faster until it reaches its maximum motor speed and falls
// over.  That's where the next constants come in.
const int16_t ANGLE_RESPONSE = 11;

// DISTANCE_RESPONSE determines how much the robot resists being
// moved away from its starting point.  Counterintuitively, this
// constant is positive: to move forwards, the robot actually has
// to first roll its wheels backwards, so that it can *fall*
// forwards.  When this constant is adjusted properly, the robot
// will no longer zoom off in one direction, but it will drive
// back and forth a few times before falling down.
const int16_t DISTANCE_RESPONSE = 73;

// DISTANCE_DIFF_RESPONSE determines the response to differences
// between the left and right motors, preventing undesired
// rotation due to differences in the motors and gearing.  Unlike
// DISTANCE_REPONSE, it should be negative: if the left motor is
// lagging, we need to increase its speed and decrease the speed
// of the right motor.  If this constant is too small, the robot
// will spin left and right as it rocks back and forth; if it is
// too large it will become unstable.
const int16_t DISTANCE_DIFF_RESPONSE = -50;

// SPEED_RESPONSE supresses the large back-and-forth oscillations
// caused by DISTANCE_RESPONSE.  Increase this until these
// oscillations die down after a few cycles; but if you increase
// it too much it will tend to shudder or vibrate wildly.
const int16_t SPEED_RESPONSE = 3300; // Was 3300

// The balancing code is all based on a 100 Hz update rate; if
// you change this, you will have to adjust many other things.

// encoder measurements, which will cause it to drive in the
// corresponding direction.  Differing values for left and right
// will result in a turn.
void balanceDrive(int16_t leftSpeed, int16_t rightSpeed);

// robot is trying to balance.  When it falls down it shuts off
// the motors, and this function will return false.  If you pick
// the robot up, this function will start returning true again.

// and you will be able to resume balancing immediately when you
// are done.
